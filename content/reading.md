This is a collection of various readings I like. Rather than novels, this list will focus more on things like blog posts, tutorials, etc, and will mainly be about programming/statistics/tech.


* [How to Debug Small Programs](https://ericlippert.com/2014/03/05/how-to-debug-small-programs/) by Eric Lippert - A fantastic bit of writing on how to approach debugging as a beginner.

* [You Cant Dig Upwards](https://www.evanmiller.org/you-cant-dig-upwards.html) - by Evan Miller. Piece about why C is a good first language to learn. Note, I strongly disagree with Evan on this piece, but its a great piece of writing.

* [Dont Teach Students the Hard Way First](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-hard-way/) - Piece by David Robinson that argues the opposite philosophy to Evans above.

* [Teach the Tidyverse to Beginners](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach-tidyverse/) - Earlier piece of David Robinsons teaching philosophy, more specific to R.

* [Teach ggplot2 to beginners](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach_ggplot2_to_beginners/) - Another piece from David about his teaching philosophy
  * Seriously, just go read all of [David Robinsons](http://varianceexplained.org/posts/) stuff. He's such a good writer.

* [Data Driven Logo Design with ggraph and gtable](https://www.data-imaginist.com/2016/data-driven-logo/) by Thomas Pedersen - Thomas showing how he created the logo for his blog, entirely within R.

* [Taking control of animations in R and demystifying them in the process](https://www.data-imaginist.com/2017/animating-the-logo/) by Thomas Pedersen - Follow up to previous post, showing how to add animation to the logo.

* [Introduction to dplyr](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/dplyr.html) by Hadley Wickham - Best way to get started with analysing tabular data in R
