<p>Recently I was working on my WIP package ‘verhoeff’, for calculating check digits based on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verhoeff_algorithm">Verhoeff algorithim</a>. I was at the stage where most of the basic code was written, so I was starting to test simple examples.</p>
<p>I was testing an early implementation which I thought would work. I used the code</p>
<pre class="r"><code>calculate_digit(prepare_number(1), dat$d5, dat$d5_p, dat$inv_v)</code></pre>
<p>In this code, <code>prepare_number</code> simply does some checks to see if the number is valid, and converts it to a numeric vector. The other arguments are the matrices needed for the Verhoeff math.</p>
<p>I got the error:</p>
<pre><code>Error in d5_p[(i%%8) + 1, number + 1] + 1 : 
  non-numeric argument to binary operator</code></pre>
<p>The traceback showed this came from the code</p>
<pre class="r"><code>d5_p_calc &lt;- function(d5_p, i, number) {
  d5_p[(i %% 8) + 1, number + 1] + 1
}</code></pre>
<p>My first step in debugging this was to load the matrix I needed and write bits of the function by hand. I know that I use the <code>%%</code> operator, so I assumed one of its arguments was not numeric.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>d5_matrix &lt;- matrix(c(&quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;7&quot;, &quot;8&quot;, &quot;9&quot;,
                        &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;0&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;7&quot;, &quot;8&quot;, &quot;9&quot;, &quot;0&quot;,
                        &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;7&quot;, &quot;8&quot;, &quot;9&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;,
                        &quot;3&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;8&quot;, &quot;9&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;7&quot;,
                        &quot;4&quot;, &quot;0&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;9&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;7&quot;, &quot;8&quot;,
                        &quot;5&quot;, &quot;9&quot;, &quot;8&quot;, &quot;7&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;0&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;1&quot;,
                        &quot;6&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;9&quot;, &quot;8&quot;, &quot;7&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;0&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;2&quot;,
                        &quot;7&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;9&quot;, &quot;8&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;0&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;3&quot;,
                        &quot;8&quot;, &quot;7&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;9&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;0&quot;, &quot;4&quot;,
                        &quot;9&quot;, &quot;8&quot;, &quot;7&quot;, &quot;6&quot;, &quot;5&quot;, &quot;4&quot;, &quot;3&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;1&quot;, &quot;0&quot;),
                      nrow = 10, ncol = 10)

# Here I&#39;m breaking the problem down by dropping the final `+ 1`
d5_matrix[(1 %% 8) + 1, 3 + 1]</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] &quot;4&quot;</code></pre>
<p>So that ran fine. Hmm, so the error cant be with <code>%%</code>. What happens if we add the final <code>+ 1</code> that is missing</p>
<pre class="r"><code>d5_matrix[(1 %% 8) + 1, 3 + 1] + 1</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Error in d5_matrix[(1%%8) + 1, 3 + 1] + 1: non-numeric argument to binary operator</code></pre>
<p>Ah ha! Now we’ve reproduced our error. So why does adding one to a matrix throw a non-numeric error?</p>
<p>Well if you look back at the matrix I created, you notice I did something veeeeery silly. All of the numbers that make up the matrix are quoted - so they make a <em>character</em> matrix not a <em>numeric</em> matrix. And you cant add the number 1 to a character.</p>
<p>Once I made the matrix integers instead of characters, it worked fine!</p>
