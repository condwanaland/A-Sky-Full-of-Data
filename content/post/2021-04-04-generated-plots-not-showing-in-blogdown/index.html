<p>Debugging why my plots weren’t showing up in blogdown</p>
<!--more-->
<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: please see my new <a href="https://conorneilson.com/post/generated-plots/">post</a> on this topic where things now just work</p>
<p>While writing my last post, I discovered that while using <code>blogdown::serve_site()</code>, any plots generated by R code weren’t showing up in the website.</p>
<p>The first thing I did was remove the <code>.gitignore</code> file under my <code>static</code> directory. This unfortunately didn’t fix the issue (but I suspect was still a contributor to the final fix.)</p>
<p>The second thing I did was add a setup R chunk that had the code <code>knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, fig.path = "static")</code> in it. So for clarity, a chunk like</p>
<pre><code>```{r setup}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, fig.path = &quot;static&quot;)
```</code></pre>
<p>right at the top of my page.</p>
<p>Once I added that, everything worked fine. I don’t really understand what’s going on here, but clearly my blog doesn’t realise that figures are being rendered to ‘static’, and we have to tell it to look there.</p>
<p>If anyone else is having this problem, I hope this helps.</p>
