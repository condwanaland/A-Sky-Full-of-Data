While working on my (currently WIP) package `nebula`, I ran into an issue with resetting the `fileInput` component in Shiny. 

In short, `nebula` allows you to upload a photo of an [otolith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otolith) (fish ear bone), and mark the positions of the growth rings (like in a tree trunk). Once you've finished, you can download the positions as a csv file. 

The issue I ran into, is once you've finished marking your photo, if you want to then start a new photo, you need some way of resetting the `fileInput`, and removing the current photo. This then allows the user to upload a new photo and repeat the process. 

I started implementing this by using the awesome [`reset`](https://rdrr.io/cran/shinyjs/man/reset.html) function from `shinyjs`. This *almost* worked. It reset all the other elements of my app (`selectInput`s, `textInputs`s etc), but it didn't reset the `fileInput`. After the `reset` button was clicked, the uploaded image was still visible in the UI.

If you dig around online you'll notice that many people have [brought](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44203728/how-to-reset-a-value-of-fileinput-in-shiny) [this up on](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49344468/resetting-fileinput-in-shiny-app) [Stack](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17352086/how-can-i-update-a-shiny-fileinput-object) [Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44278944/r-shiny-doesnt-reset-fileinput-and-and-keeps-it-in-memory), [Github](https://github.com/daattali/shinyjs/issues/104), and [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/shiny-discuss/HbTa4v612FA). It's a fairly common problem,  across all of web design, not just R/Shiny. While a few solutions were suggested in those posts I had a lot of trouble making any of these work, primarily because of the complexity of my upload function (this is my own fault - I should have been more aggressive in refactoring, but this opened up a different can of worms).

I struggled for a while on how to solve this. Several unsuccessful refactors later, I was still without a solution. Eventually I realised that the reset behaviour I was looking for was essentially a full reload - I want to reset the app back to when it was first loaded in the browser, preserving no state. So I started searching to see if there was someway to reload the Shiny app within Shiny itself. 

I searched a bit, and discovered the javascript method `history.go`. This has the effect of moving across your browsers history. For example, executing `history.go(-1)` has the effect of going back one page. I discovered that if you use `history.go(0)`, this effectively reloads the page. 

Now all I needed was a way to execute this from a shiny button press. There are a variety of ways of doing this, but by far the easiest way is `runjs` from the `shinyjs` package. The solution I ended up with was:

For the UI
```{r, eval=FALSE}
actionButton("resetAll", "Reset All")
```

And the server
```{r, eval=FALSE}
  observeEvent(input$resetAll, {
    runjs("history.go(0)")
  })
```


While reloading the entire page is a slightly crude solution, it did mean I was enable to eliminate the rest of the `reset` code I had for other UI components, and just rely on the full page reload. In addition, from a code perspective, this is an extremely compact and simple solution (~3 lines of code). While it does introduce javascript to the app, I find this is a simpler solution than many of the others online. 

While this solution only works for a subset of problems, hopefully others may find it useful if you're also struggling with the confusing behaviour of resetting fileInput
