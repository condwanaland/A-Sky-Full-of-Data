<p>I’m thrilled to announce the release of my new package <a href="https://github.com/condwanaland/words">words</a>. <code>words</code> is an extremely simple package, but I’m excited to use it for my future projects.</p>
<p>Recently I’ve been playing around with some word based puzzles in R. One of the examples of this is <a href="https://github.com/condwanaland/wordbuilder"><code>wordbuilder</code></a>, which finds all valid words of from a given list of 5 letters. In an example like this, one of the challenges is finding a list of valid english words.</p>
<p>One of the first examples that comes up when you search for english words is <a href="https://github.com/dwyl/english-words">this repo</a>. While I started using this, I realised that its main issue was it contained abbreviations, with no simple way of filtering them out. With a bit more searching, I found a collection of json files hosted by <a href="https://www.wordgamedictionary.com/word-lists/">Word Game Dictionary</a> that contain words allowed in scrabble.</p>
<p>Usage of <code>words</code> is extremely simple - it contains just a single dataset!</p>
<p><code>words</code> is available on CRAN, so you can download it with</p>
<pre class="r"><code>install.packages(&quot;words&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>From there, just call <code>data</code> to load the word dataset.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(words)
data(&quot;words&quot;)</code></pre>
<p>The word dataset just contains 2 columns. One for the words, and one showing the length of each word.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>head(words)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##   word word_length
## 1   aa           2
## 2   ab           2
## 3   ad           2
## 4   ae           2
## 5   ag           2
## 6   ah           2</code></pre>
<p>If you do any projects in R that require word dictionaries, I hope you’ll find <code>words</code> useful.</p>
