<p>In a <a href="https://conorneilson.com/post/generated-plots-not-showing-in-blogdown/">previous post</a> I described how plots generated via R code weren’t showing in my posts. The fix I ultimately found was to set a particular <code>knitr</code> chunk. I didn’t really understand it, but it seemed to work.</p>
<p>This no longer seems to be the case. I tried generating some plots today to test, and they work out of the box now. Check the code below - there are no other <code>knitr</code> chunks in this document. Not sure what has changed, but I’m happy!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot(1:10)</code></pre>

<pre class="r"><code>library(ggplot2)
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length)) + geom_point()</code></pre>
