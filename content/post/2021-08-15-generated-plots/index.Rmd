In a [previous post](https://conorneilson.com/post/generated-plots-not-showing-in-blogdown/) I described how plots generated via R code weren't showing in my posts. The fix I ultimately found was to set a particular `knitr` chunk. I didn't really understand it, but it seemed to work.

This no longer seems to be the case. I tried generating some plots today to test, and they work out of the box now. Check the code below - there are no other `knitr` chunks in this document. Not sure what has changed, but I'm happy!

```{r}
plot(1:10)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(iris, aes(x = Sepal.Length, y = Petal.Length)) + geom_point()
```
