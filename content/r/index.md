title: R Packages
---

I've written several R packages, mostly for my own learning and enjoyment. I started writing packages when I finished my MSc, and kinda just kept on doing it here and there. This is a list of everything I consider it be either in a useable state, or is being actively developed on. 

-   [scrobbler](/r/scrobbler/): Download 'Scrobbles' from 'Last.fm'

-   [fishdata](/r/fishdata/): A Small Collection of Fish Population Datasets

-   [verhoeff](/r/verhoeff/): Implementation of the 'Verhoeff' Check Digit Algorithm

-   [opentriviadb](/r/opentriviadb/): R Interface to the 'Open Trivia Database'
